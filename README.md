The purpose of the visualization depicted below is to understand the health risks facing particular demographics after reviewing information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  The data set is based on the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates, which includes data on rates of income, obseity, poverty, etc. by state: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml

After analyzing the lack of healthcare to poverty levels by state, it appears that the higher the population is in poverty in each state, then the higher the percentage of those people will be without healthcare.  The top three states that had the least amount of healthcare coverage were as follows:

1) Texas has the lowest healthcare coverage of 24.9% with 17.2% of their population in poverty.
2) Georgia has the second lowest healthcare coverage of 20.9% with 18.3% of their population in poverty.
3) Mississippi has the third lowest healthcare coverage of 18.8% with the highest poverty rate of 21.5%.
